                    <p>This game was developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap and Javascript.<br>
                        <br>In the game, the computer picks a random state out of the 13 states that originally declared independence from England and the British Crown. The user is given a hint by the dashes that show the length of the state name. The
                        user is given chances equal to the length of the state picked to type the correct state. When a user gets all the 13 states correct, the computer will notify the user that he has won the game and will play The Spangled Banner.
                        If a user has not won the game, an uplifting background sound is then played and the user can then refresh the page and start the game again.
                        <br><br>When a letter is typed on the keyboard, it is removed from the Available Letters pool and placed either in the input field represented by the dashes if the letter exists in the state name. If the letter is not in the state
                        name, it is put in the quarantine area so that it is not available again for the user to type it from the Available letters pool.

                    <p>This game was developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery.
                        <br>In the game, the computer picks a random number between 19 and 120 which is used as the target the player should match.
                        <br>
                        <br> The user is then given four crystals which also have random number attributes between 1 and 12. The user only knows the random number assigned to the crystal when he/she clicks on the crystal.
                        <br> The crystal random number is accumulated to a score. Each time a crystal is clicked, the random number assigned to the crystal is added to the score. If the score matches the target number, then the player wins the game. If
                        the score exceeds the target then the player has lost the game. The game restarts after 5 seconds and the player can start again.

                    <p>This game was developed using HTML5, CSS3, Bootstrap, Javascript and JQuery. The Bootstrap Jumbotron component is used. A set of single arrays and multidimensional arrays have been used to store data that is used in the game.
                        <br>In the game, the player is given a set of multiple choice questions to answer that are randomly picked by the computer. A counter is invoked when a question is displayed. If the counter reaches 0 seconds, the game displays
                        an out of time message and the correct answer. An unanswered question counter is incremented. If the user correctly answers the question, the user is advised that the answer is correct and a correct answers counter is incremented.
                        If an incorrect answer is given, the computer displays the correct answer and increments the incorrect answers counter. In all cases an image representing the answer is displayed. Questions are automatically displayed without the
                        need of a mouse click or key press. This is achieved through the use of the setInterval timer.
                        <br>
                        <br> When all questions have been answered, the game displays the results of the questions and a Start Over button.
                        <br> The objective of this game is to develop a web application that uses JQuery to update the page and Javascript for the game logic. The Start Over button does not reload the page, it just re-initializes the data used in the
                        game and starts the questions again. CSS has been used in the logic to show or hide some parts of the page.

                    <p>This application demonstrates the use of AJAX calls to APIs. API (Application Programming Interfaces) allow connectivity and exchange of data between systems housed in different organizations. We are able to access data and system
                        functions programmatically without human interface. This is achieved through APIs resident in those systems that are exposed via a URL. Search parameters are provided through the URL as per the API specification and the API responds
                        with the requested data. The response is then processed in our application to achieve the desired needs of our clients.<br><br> In this application, we retrieve giphy images from https://media.giphy.com through preset buttons created
                        on the website through JQuery. A user is also able to dynamically create a button and use that to retrieve gifs. The user can save the giphy images to a favorite section. To save the images, I am using localstorage for persistence.
                        I am using an array of objects to save to localstorage with JSON stringify and JSON parse method to retrieve the image.<br>

                    <p>This Rock, Paper, Scissors game is a multiplayer game that is played over the internet by two players. It uses the Google Firebase NoSQL Cloud database for persistence and updates to the two players user interfaces. In this application,
                        Vanilla JavaScript is used for the web page updates. No JQuery is used in this application. The players are given turns to select Rock, Paper or Scissors. The computer will then determine which player won the round and maintain
                        the statistics of the game. The players can tease each other via chat in the game.
