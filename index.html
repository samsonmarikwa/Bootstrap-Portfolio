                <p>I am detail-oriented Web Application Architect keen on eliminating waste in resources through process automation and low-cost ubiquitous technology. I am customer-centric, without a happy customer we have no business being here. My desired
                    achievement in any project I undertake is to have a product that provides an aesthetic interface that has the impact of engaging the customer. The website should speak to the customer as to the quality of products and services at his
                    or her disposal as it provides the first point of contact between our company and the customer. The customer should be able to access products and services from our organization without travelling to or calling our offices. That should
                    enhance our customer's productivity in that they can transact at any place and time of their choice.<br><br>My skills and experiences enable me to take up the role of a full stack web developer. On the technical side, I am skilled
                    in both front and backend technologies. My skills include HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript, JQuery, AJAX and the use of various libraries such as Bootstrap, ReactJS for front-end development. For backend development, I am skilled in the use
                    of Google Firebase tools, MySQL database, Mongo DB and development tools such as Node.js and Express, C# and ASP.net. I am experienced in the use of a number of packages in npmjs. I am also skilled in the use of GitHub for code management.
                    On the business side, I am skilled in business processes in order fulfilment (O2C and P2P) as well as financial processes (General Ledger, Cashbook, Asset Register, Receivables and Payables) and reporting. On the side of soft skills,
                    although I can work alone, I am much happier working as part of a team bouncing off ideas with other team members and sharing tasks for a quick turnaround in project delivery. I communicate well with other peers and I am able to sustain
                    professional relationships. I can hold workshops on topics as a means to educate or elicit requirements for system development.
                    <br><br>My motivation is to see people thriving and deriving benefit from systems that leverage technological advances to carry out their activities easily, be they business or personal such as how GPS navigation has become indispensable
                    for todayâ€™s traveller.
